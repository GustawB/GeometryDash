# GeometryDash
 The worst possible copy of the GD


My first project after a few months. I hate this project, movement is based 100% on tick functionso everything is frame-dependent, I had to make too much math functions so that the game doesn't look like crap, and guess what? Those functions are triggered in tick functions too. Better yet, when I was trying to lock frames at 60fps, I realized I developed everything while working with 120 fps. Definitely my worst project.
